# DERA Submission

This is my submission for the React app I was asked to make

## Features

- I used Material UI for the UI
- I used zustand for state management
- I used a JSON file to store the book details and are fetched with javascript's fetch API
- I added search and filter features
- I hosted it on vercel: [DERA-Submission live site](https://link-url-here.org).
